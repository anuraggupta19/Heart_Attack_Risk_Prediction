# Objective:
The primary objective of the Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model that can analyze and predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on the medical history of patients. The goal is to leverage advanced data analytics and predictive modeling techniques to improve the early detection of individuals at risk of experiencing a heart attack.<br>
The specific objectives include:<br>
1. Data Collection, Exploration and Preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Feature Selection and Engineering.
4. Machine Learning Model Development.
5. Model Evaluation and Optimization.
